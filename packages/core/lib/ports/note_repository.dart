/// Storage contract for notes and tags.
///
/// Declared in core so the domain services depend on a behaviour rather than on
/// SQLite. packages/data provides the implementation (`SqliteNoteRepository`).
///
/// **Every method is synchronous, and that is deliberate.** The previous
/// version of this file declared seven `Future`-returning methods on the
/// grounds that "the concrete implementation runs on a worker isolate". That
/// inverted the real topology: `package:sqlite3` is a synchronous FFI binding,
/// so the repository *is* synchronous and runs **inside** the isolate,
/// alongside the services declared here. The asynchronous boundary is the
/// isolate message port, which `NexDbWorker` owns on the UI side — it is a
/// client of this contract, not an implementation of it.
///
/// The surface is deliberately narrow: it is what the domain services in this
/// package actually call, nothing more. `SqliteNoteRepository` exposes a
/// superset (sync outbox, backup, export, undelete) that only the storage and
/// application layers need.

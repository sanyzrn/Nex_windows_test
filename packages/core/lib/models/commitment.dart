/// These are deliberately **not notes**, and the reasons are worth stating
/// because "it could be a note with a repeating reminder" is the first thing
/// anybody proposes.
///
/// - A note belongs on the timeline. These do not. A tablet every eight hours
///   is three rows a day, every day, for as long as the course lasts; water is
///   six. Inside a month that is two hundred rows of a stream whose whole
///   claim is that it is worth scrolling.
/// - "Done" means something different. A note's reminder, once it has rung
///   and been seen, is spent. A commitment that has been met is not finished —
///   it is due again, and the useful thing the app can do at that moment is
///   work out when.
/// - They carry a notion a note has no field for: how far in advance being
///   reminded is any use. A year's insurance is worth raising a week out. Two
///   days out is right for the rent, and useless for the water.
///
/// Everything here is pure and has no storage in it, so the arithmetic — the
/// part that is actually hard — is tested without a database and without a

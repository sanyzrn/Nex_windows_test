/// Two things it is careful about, both learned the hard way:

/// - **It rebuilds on a change of direction, not on a change of value.** A

///   dragged through a widget that is being rebuilt under it is a selection
///   that fights back. Nothing below depends on the value, only on the

/// - **The [Directionality] is always there**, carrying the ambient direction

///   the shape of the tree, and the element below it is rebuilt from scratch —

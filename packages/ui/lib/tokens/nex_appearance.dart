/// The four films that turn a blurred backdrop into glass.
///
/// A blur on its own is not a material: it leaves the backdrop's own range
/// intact, so a panel over a dark note is dark and the same panel over a pale
/// one is pale, and no tint that is transparent enough to see through can
/// carry text on both. The fix the previous pass reached for was to stop
/// seeing through it at all — a tint at 86% over a sigma-32 blur, which is a
/// painted panel wearing a blur, not glass.
///
/// Apple's own kit does something better, and the structure here is its
/// structure, read out of the iOS 27 UI kit's `Button - Liquid Glass`
/// (`Refraction 70 · Frost 6 · Opacity 25`). Two flat films squeeze the
/// backdrop's range toward the middle, an additive film lifts the floor, and
/// a luminosity film pins the result's brightness while leaving the
/// backdrop's hue alone. What comes out is translucent — a blue note behind
/// the glass really does tint it blue — and yet lands inside a band narrow
/// enough that one text colour reads on all of it.
///
/// Where this departs from the kit is *where* that band sits, and the reason
/// is in `nex_tokens.dart` beside the numbers: Apple's light band is pinned
/// near white, and a panel on a near-white page that comes out near white is
/// a material nobody can see. The band was moved down until a panel reads as
/// a shape lying on the page. The light anchor is bright enough to feel like
/// frosted glass, while the contrast tests keep text legible over the extremes

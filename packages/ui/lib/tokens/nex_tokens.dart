/// * **A card's fill is not the page's fill.** They were both `#FFFFFF` once,
///   which left a 1.20:1 hairline as the only thing separating a note from the
///   page behind it — below the point many people can resolve a boundary at
///   all, on the app's main tap target. The page is a tone off the card now,
///   the border clears 3:1, and a shadow sits under it: three signals where
///   there was one.
/// * **A boundary and a divider are not the same token.** `border` marks
///   something you can act on and is held to 3:1; `borderSoft` is decoration
///   between rows and is deliberately quiet. One token was doing both jobs, so
///   both were wrong.
///
/// Three values here are one to seven steps off what was picked by eye, and
/// the arithmetic is the reason: `#969595` came to 2.99 against white and

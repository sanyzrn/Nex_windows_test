/// A page with a sparkle beside it: "make something shorter out of this".

/// Not a Material glyph, because none of them says it. `summarize` is a page
/// with lines on it, which is what every other document icon in the app also
/// is — in a row of actions it read as "text", and nobody could tell from it
/// what the button would do. The sparkle is what the whole industry now uses
/// to mean "the machine will do this bit", and putting it on the page is the
/// difference between an icon that names a file type and one that names an
/// action.
///
/// Painted rather than composed from two glyphs so the sparkle can cut into
/// the page's outline instead of sitting on top of it. Two overlapping icons
/// leave a tangle of crossing strokes at small sizes, which is exactly the
/// size this is used at.
///
/// Takes its colour and size from the ambient [IconTheme], the same as
/// [Icon], so it drops into a row of icons without being told anything.

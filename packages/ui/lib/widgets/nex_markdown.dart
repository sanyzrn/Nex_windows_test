/// Markdown, rendered the way the rest of Nex renders the user's own writing.
///
/// This exists because two different things in Nex are already Markdown and
/// were being shown as if they were not: a `.md` file someone shares into the
/// app, and every answer the assistant writes. A model asked for a list
/// produces one; without this the user reads the asterisks.
///
/// ## Direction
///
/// The same rule as [NexTextSurface], and the reason this is a widget rather than
/// a call to `MarkdownBody` at each site. `flutter_markdown_plus` takes its
/// direction from the ambient [Directionality] — which is the interface
/// language, and in this app the interface language is not what decides. A
/// Persian document read while the app is in English would otherwise come out
/// left-aligned with its bullets on the wrong side: correct glyphs, wrong page.
/// So the direction is derived from the text and imposed here.
///
/// That is a whole-document decision, and it is the honest limit of this
/// widget: a file whose paragraphs alternate between Persian and English gets
/// one direction for all of them, chosen by whichever script dominates. Every
/// renderer surveyed either did the same thing or ignored the ambient
/// direction entirely, and per-block direction is a larger piece of work than
/// the problem has so far earned.
///
/// ## Styling
///
/// Derived from the app's own theme rather than the package's defaults, and
/// deliberately quieter than the web's. A heading inside a note is a heading
/// within a page that is itself small — `h1` at browser scale turns a
/// three-line note into a poster. So the ramp is compressed, and the body text
/// keeps the same size and line height it has everywhere else in the app.

  /// same paragraph stopped answering a tap — and its menu is Flutter's
  /// default one, which carries every other app's `ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT`
  /// entry. Callers that wanted both worked around it by wrapping this in an
  /// area themselves and passing false; doing it here means nobody has to
  /// know that, and the menu is the app's own either way.

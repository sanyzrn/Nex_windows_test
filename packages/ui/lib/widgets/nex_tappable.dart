/// A control that is at least [nexMinTapTarget] across and says where the
/// keyboard is.
///
/// Two problems it exists to solve, both of which every custom control in the
/// app had:
///
/// * **Tap targets.** The filter pills were 34px tall and the type button 32,
///   against a token in this very package asking for 44 and platform guidance
///   asking for 48. They are horizontally scrolling targets, which is the
///   hardest case for accurate acquisition there is. The visual size is
///   unchanged here — the target grows around it.
/// * **Focus.** The only focus affordance in the app was a 16% fill tint: a
///   grey wash on a grey control. Windows is a shipped platform with its own CI
///   build and an installer, so "the keyboard is somewhere and you cannot see
///   where" is a state a real user reaches.

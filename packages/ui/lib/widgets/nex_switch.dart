/// Material 3 lays its switch out at 52x32 and offers no way to ask for less
/// — there is no size on `Switch`, and none on `SwitchThemeData` either. Next
/// to a 56px settings row carrying an icon, a title and a subtitle, that is
/// the loudest thing on the line, and it is the second time it has been
/// reported as out of proportion with everything around it. Shrinking the
/// thumb's tick and its tap padding, which is all the theme can reach, was
/// not enough.
///
/// So the real control is scaled into a smaller box. Scaling rather than
/// re-drawing on purpose: a hand-painted switch would have to reimplement the
/// thumb animation, the drag-to-toggle, the pressed overlay and the semantics
/// that say "switch, on" to a screen reader, and every one of those is a way
/// to be subtly worse than the platform for the sake of eight pixels.
///
/// The tap target does not shrink with it. This is meant to sit in the
/// trailing slot of a row that is itself tappable and at least 48 high — see
/// [NexSwitchTile] — so the thing a finger aims at is the whole line, which
/// is both larger than the switch ever was and easier to hit.

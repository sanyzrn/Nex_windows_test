/// A light that travels around a shape's border.
///
/// Meant for the two surfaces where a model is doing something: the brief at
/// the top of the timeline, and the box the assistant is typed into. It says
/// "this is generated" without a badge, a sparkle or a word — which is the
/// same reason the brief lost its heading.
///
/// Written here rather than pulled in: the effect was asked for as a React
/// package, and there is no React in this app. What a package like that does
/// is a rotating sweep gradient stroked along a rounded rectangle, which is
/// forty lines of `CustomPainter` and no dependency.
///
/// It does not run forever. A light going round and round in the corner of a
/// notes app is a battery cost with no reader — and, less obviously, an
/// animation that never ends means `pumpAndSettle` never settles, so every
/// test that so much as opens a screen carrying one hangs. Both of those are
/// the same fact about perpetual motion: nothing is being marked.
///
/// So it runs [laps] times and rests, and plays again when [token] changes —
/// which is what actually happens: a request starts, an answer lands. The
/// controller is stopped rather than hidden when [active] is false, and the
/// beam stands still when the platform asks for reduced motion.

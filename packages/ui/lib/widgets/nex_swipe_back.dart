/// away from the leading edge takes you back, mirrored under RTL so a Persian
/// reader drags the way the text runs. What it does not give is *reach*: the
/// gesture is only recognised inside a 20-logical-pixel strip at the very
/// edge, which on a large phone is the one part of the screen a thumb has to
/// stretch for. The back arrow is at the same far corner, so a screen with a
/// long list had two ways back and both of them were in the corner.
///
/// So the Cupertino transition is kept exactly as it is — it owns the motion,
/// and its own edge gesture keeps working — and the page it wraps gains a
/// second recogniser spanning the whole width. Anything horizontally
/// scrollable inside the page still wins the gesture arena against it: a
/// recogniser closer to the pointer beats one further up the tree, which is
/// why dragging a row of tag chips still scrolls the chips.

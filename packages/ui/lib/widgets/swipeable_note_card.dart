/// * A resting card starts a swipe from either outer edge — 45% of its width
///   on each side (see [_leadingZone] and [_trailingZone]), leaving a narrow
///   strip down the middle that starts nothing. The whole card used to open on
///   any sideways drag, which is also where a thumb naturally lands while
///   scrolling past one.
/// * The offset is animated by a spring rather than assigned from the raw
///   pointer delta, so releasing settles instead of snapping.
/// * A gesture cannot cross the middle. Once a direction is picked, dragging
///   back closes the card and stops at zero — it used to sail through and open
///   the *opposite* action, so swiping back from Delete landed on Add Tag.
/// * Dragging most of the way across commits the action on release, the way
///   Mail on iOS does, instead of requiring a second tap on the panel.
/// * Only one card in a list is open at a time, and a scroll closes it.
/// * Which action each edge runs is the app's business, not this widget's:
///   [resolveAction] hands back a [NexSwipeActionSpec] and [onAction] is told
///   which one ran.
